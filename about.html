        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>
            I'm Ketaki Shinde, a passionate computer science student with a focus on Big Data Analytics, Data Science, and Machine Learning. 
            "Passionate, skilled, and intrinsically motivated to uncover my talents, build on my strengths, and
            continuously improve, all with the goal of realizing my full potential. With valuable experience gained through
            internships, I have honed my skills in real-world settings. Currently, I am working on data science and
            machine learning projects to further develop my expertise. Additionally, as the leader of a students’ club, I
            foster collaboration and innovation, driving impactful initiatives while enhancing my leadership abilities."
            <br><br>
            In my journey, I've participated in prestigious hackathons like Pragyan (NIT Trichy), IBM Z-Datathon, SRM Ideathon, and Vaishisth (IIIT DM), where I’ve honed my skills in problem-solving and teamwork. 
            <br><br>
            From building an AI-powered tumor detection system to developing a social media platform for pet parents, I constantly strive to innovate and solve real-world challenges. 
            Apart from coding, I enjoy public speaking and have been involved in debates and panel discussions, sharpening my communication skills. Oh, and I also hold a brown belt in Karate!
